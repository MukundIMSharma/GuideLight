Global warming is primarily driven by the enhanced greenhouse effect, a natural process that has been amplified by human activities. The most significant cause is the release of greenhouse gases—particularly carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), and nitrous oxide (N₂O)—into the atmosphere. These emissions result from burning fossil fuels for electricity, transportation, and industry; deforestation and land‑use changes that reduce the planet’s capacity to absorb CO₂; and agricultural practices that produce large amounts of methane and nitrous oxide. Additional contributors include industrial processes that emit fluorinated gases, as well as the cumulative effect of aerosols and other pollutants that alter atmospheric composition. Together, these factors increase the atmospheric concentration of heat‑trapping gases, raising Earth’s average temperature and driving the observed trends in global warming.
