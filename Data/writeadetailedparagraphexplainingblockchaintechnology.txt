Blockchain technology is a decentralized, distributed ledger system that records transactions across a network of computers in a manner that is transparent, tamper‑proof, and immutable. Each transaction is grouped into a “block,” which is cryptographically linked to the preceding block through a hash function, creating a chronological chain of data. The network operates on a consensus mechanism—such as proof‑of‑work, proof‑of‑stake, or delegated proof‑of‑stake—ensuring that all participants agree on the validity of the ledger without relying on a central authority. Once a block is added, its contents cannot be altered without re‑computing the cryptographic hash of every subsequent block, which would require an infeasible amount of computational effort. This inherent security, combined with the ability to execute smart contracts (self‑executing code that automatically enforces contractual terms), makes blockchain a powerful platform for applications ranging from cryptocurrencies and supply‑chain management to secure voting systems and digital identity verification.
